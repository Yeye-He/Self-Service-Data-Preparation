# "Self Service" Data Preparation

## Overview
It is widely [cited](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3418832/market-guide-for-self-service-data-preparation) that data analysts and data scientists today spend a large fraction (up to 80%) of their time on preparing and cleaning data.

At Microsoft Research, we are looking at ways to automate common data preparation tasks, where the goal is to empower enterprise workers as well as less-technical end-users (e.g., in Excel, Power BI, etc.), to solve their data preparation challenges and improve their productivity.

Technologies developed in this project have shipped as features in Microsoft products, such as in [Power Query](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query) (natively integrated in Excel under the “Data” tab, also available in Power BI), and [Azure Machine Learning Data Prep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-dataprep/?view=azure-ml-py).
